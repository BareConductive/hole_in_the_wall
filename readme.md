# Bare Conductive "Hole in the Wall" Game

Simple game that uses the [Bare Conductive Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/touch-board/) and the [Adafruit NeoPixel Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1430).

In order to use the NeoPixel shield and play sounds simultaneously, the connection between the digital pin D6 and Din on the NeoPixel shield needs to be interrupted by cutting a trace. The NeoPixel Din pin then needs to be connected to pin 11 on the Touch Board. 

Three MP3 files (named TRACK000.mp3, TRACK001.mp3 and TRACK002.mp3) are used to add sound effects to the game. You can download these MP3 files [here](http://www.bareconductive.com/assets/resources/hole_in_the_wall_audio.zip). 

The electrodes on the Touch Board have following functions:

* E0 - Increase volume (if audio is enabled)
* E1 - Decrease volume (if audio is enabled)
* E4 - Move user to the left
* E5 - Start or reset the game
* E6 - Move user to the right
* E10 - Increase brightness
* E11 - Decrease brightness

Connect anything conductive to each electrode to create an interface for the game - note that you can create a minimal interface with just E4, E5 and E6. You can also download a template [here](http://bareconductive.com/assets/resources/hole_in_the_wall_controller.zip) to create a paper controller using our [Electrical Paint](https://www.bareconductive.com/shop/electric-paint-10ml/). 

## Requirements
* You should make sure that you have followed our [Setting up Arduino with your Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/make/setting-up-arduino-with-your-touch-board/) tutorial before using this (or any other) of our code examples

## License 
This code example is licensed under the MIT license. See [license.md](https://github.com/BareConductive/hole_in_the_wall/blob/public/license.md) for details. 


## Install
1. Close the Arduino IDE if you have it open.
1. Download the [.zip](https://github.com/BareConductive/hole_in_the_wall/archive/public.zip) or clone the repository to your local machine - if downloading the .zip, extract the contents somewhere that suits you.
1. Take the **hole_in_the_wall** folder and move it to **Arduino Sketchbook Folder**. This will be different for each operating system: 

	**Windows**
	
	Libraries\\Documents\\Arduino
	
	or
	
	My Documents\\Arduino	
	
	**Mac**
	
	Documents/Arduino
	
	**Linux (Ubuntu)**
	
	Home/Arduino


	If this folder does not exist, create it first.
1. Reopen the Arduino IDE - you should now be able to open the sketch in the **File -> Sketchbook** menu.
